# HW1-Kmeans
In this project, we have a dataset that shows 30 features for each breast sample and also the truth dataset demonstrates whether the samples are malign or belign.
With these datasets we implement a source code that makes two accurate clusters by applying k-means algortihm and predicts the results. After the predictions are complete, algorithm compares it with truth dataset and finds an accuracy ratio.
